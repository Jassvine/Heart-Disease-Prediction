# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This prediction wil lprocess the data of heartdiseaseswe
took fromthe Kagglewebsite and process,clean and filter the
applicable attributestodeterminethe hiddenknowledge and
generate a prediction.Not onlycan this prediction
model predict with a high level of accuracy, it is also
expected to be able to be able to have knowledge on
complexheartdiseasestoo.Moreover,sucha prediction
system cancome in very handyto a medicalpractitionerand
aid inmaking decisions.Besides, a heart disease prediction
system isimportant asit can predict and solve problems
accurately even when there is no expert around.

To predict heart disease, the test and training data is given
as input to the algorithms and the accuracy is compared for
analysis by using dataset from UCI (Kaggle). Next, data
mining is used to discover the unknown knowledge from the
known information and build predictive model. It is a step to
discover knowledge from databases and summarizing into
useful information. This project will be finding the model
which fix better for the problem applying different metrics of
performance to reduce the prediction error (error rate) and
the best accuracy. Particularly, it will be looking at the fa lse
negative error because this mean sends home a patient who in
fact has heart disease(negative misclassification error). To identify the best model to fix the problem and classify
correctly new data, it is necessary to reduce the bias of the
estimation and reduce the variance of it. However, usually low
bia s means high variance. Therefore, it is clear it needed the
bias-variance trade-off in order to fix the model. The error
when it does not fit well into the assumptions it makes when
building the learning algorithm, and the high variance in the
estimator indicates possible overfitting in the model. The
objective-based on the re- samplingtechniquesisto achieve
